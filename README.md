🔧 Configuration
API Keys Setup
The application will prompt you to enter your API keys on first run:

OpenRouter API Key (Required): For accessing multiple AI models
Mem0 API Key (Optional): For personalization features

Keys are securely stored locally and never transmitted to external servers.
Supported AI Models

OpenAI: GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo
Anthropic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus
Google: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini Pro
Meta: LLaMA 3.1 405B, LLaMA 3.1 70B
Auto Selection: Let OpenRouter choose the best model

🎯 Core Features Deep Dive
1. Intelligent AI Selection
pythondef smart_ai_selection_with_memory(user_id, question):
    """
    Selects optimal AI model based on:
    - Question type classification
    - User's historical preferences
    - Context requirements
    - Performance characteristics
    """
2. Personalization Engine

Learning: Tracks which AI you choose for different question types
Adaptation: Improves recommendations based on your feedback
